This project explores esports game earnings data to uncover insights into game popularity, genre trends, and top earners.

Libraries:

    pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
    matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
    (Optional) NumPy: Numerical computations

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

    Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries using import statements.
    Load Data: Use pandas.read_csv or pandas.read_json to load the data depending on the format.
    Explore Data: Get an overview of the data using df.head(), df.info(), and descriptive statistics methods like df.describe().
    Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing values using techniques like imputation or deletion (if appropriate).
    Data Cleaning: Clean and format data as needed (e.g., standardize date formats, convert currencies).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    Top Earning Games: Analyze which games have the highest total earnings and average earnings per tournament.
    Genre Distribution: Explore the distribution of earnings across different esports game genres (e.g., MOBA, FPS, RTS).
    Trends Over Time: Visualize how game earnings have changed over time (e.g., yearly or quarterly trends).
    Top Earning Teams and Players: Identify the top-earning teams and players based on total earnings.

Data Visualization:

    Bar Charts: Use bar charts to compare total earnings or average earnings per tournament for different games or genres.
    Line Charts: Visualize trends in earnings over time using line charts.
    Pie Charts (Optional): Consider pie charts to represent genre distribution of earnings, ensuring clarity for a limited number of categories.

Further Analysis:

      Utilize statistical models to identify factors influencing game earnings (e.g., game genre, release year, player base).
      Explore building a machine learning model to predict future game earnings based on historical data.
